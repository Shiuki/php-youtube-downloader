# php-youtube-downloader
Download any video from internet and display it to user

Made this simple and small as possible, all you need is to have youtube-dl (pip3 install youtube_dl), future (pip install future) and python 3 installed on your machine for this to work (ofc you need php installed aswell ðŸ¤£).

It's meant to be the way it is as it was made as a part for my personal project.

Outputs raw .mp4
