# php-youtube-downloader
Download any video from internet, from youtube to your local mp4 file and display it to user

Made this simple and small as possible, all you need is to have youtube-dl (pip3 install youtube_dl) and python 3 installed on your machine for this to work.

It's meant to be the way it is as it was made as a part for my personal project.
